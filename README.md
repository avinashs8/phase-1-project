#Project Name
Cocktail Instructions and Reviews

#Description
This project will use the free API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita to build the application. The main purpose of this application is for users to learn to make cocktails. Once the user makes a cocktail, they can leave a review, so others can get their feedback on the cocktail.
