#Project Name
Cocktail Instructions and Reviews

#Description
This project will use the free API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita to build the application. The main purpose of this application is for users to learn to make cocktails. Once the user makes a cocktail, they can leave a review, so others can get their feedback on the cocktail. 

Using the images from the API, images of cocktails will be rendered onto the page, using a GET fetch request. Once the images are loaded onto the page, the user can move their mouse over whichever cocktail appeals to them, and the name of the cocktail will be rendered right above the cocktail's image. 

After the user decides which cocktail they like, they can click on the image of the cocktail, which will use a GET fetch request to render the name of the cocktail, ingredients and their measures, and instructions onto the page. 

Once the user follows the instructions to make their cocktail of choice, they can leave a review on the website, so others can see their opinion of the cocktail. This will be done by using a form element. The user will enter their review of their cocktail in an input field, and then use a submit button to post their review onto the website.
