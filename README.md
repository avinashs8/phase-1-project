#Project Name
Cocktail Instructions and Reviews

#Description
This project will use the free API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita to build the application. The main purpose of this application is for users to learn to make cocktails. Once the user makes a cocktail, they can leave a review, so others can get their feedback on the cocktail. 

Using the images from the API, images of cocktails will be rendered onto the page, using a GET fetch request. Once the images are loaded onto the page, the user can move their mouse over whichever cocktail appeals to them, and the name of the cocktail will be rendered right above the cocktail's image.
